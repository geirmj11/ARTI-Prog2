\section{Heuristic function}
The heuristic we use is quite simple(if somewhat overly optimistic). We take the manhattan distance from the current point to all patches of dirt, 
ignoring obstacles. This gives us an extremely short path length, in fact a path that can only be achieved if there is only one node left, and it is on the 
starting point. This will never overestimate the cost, since even at the extreme case where we have two nodes on each side of the current position, 
the heuristic function will return a value of 4, while the actual path is 4 plus turns(see picture). 
Since the function will never overestimate the cost, it is admissible. \\ \\

\subsection{Conclusions}
Not surprizingly Depth first search is probably the worst of the bunch. It gets the job done fast, i.e. it finds 'a' path fast, but 
picks a highly random and usually stupid path. Only once did it beat the score of 
the BFS, but since BFS doesn't take into account turning costs, this is bound to happen every once in a while.\\

Breadth first search was a surprize here, when given enough time (and not even a lot more), it gave very good results, even if it didn't take the cost 
of turning into account. A clear winner for simplicity. Relative to the other search methods it takes a lot of time, but in small cases it is quite good enough. \\

Uniform search and A* search were surprizingly slow, but this was mainly due to an implementation error in Java. We used priorityQueue to implement the searches
and found out just before handing in the assignment that remove and find operations in priority queue are incredibly slow. 
Sadly this slows down the total calculations to an unberarble speed, and as can be seen from the results, they couldn't complete most of the maps. 
This would have been easy to avoid if we would have known beforehand about this problem. \\
Our assumption is that the time complexity should be somewhere between DFS and BFS given the correct priorityQueue class
 (we are not fans of java after this assignment). However the resulting paths are brilliant, and beat both BFS and DFS every time we actually got a result.
 We hope that the code speaks for itself, the thought behind it should be correct. Hopefully you can give us a bit of feedback about what is going wrong.
